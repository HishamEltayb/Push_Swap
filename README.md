<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## PUSH_SWAP

This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the one (of many) most appropriate solution for an optimized data sorting.

Use the `Push_swap.pdf` to get started.
